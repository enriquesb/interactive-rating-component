## My process

First I created the divs that contain the elements required to solve the challenge, including one div for the "rating state" and another one for the "thank you state". Then I added the style with CSS to match the design reference for the mobile version. After that added the logic to hide the "thank you state" div when loading the website, saving the rating that is submitted by the user and then hide the "rating state" div, and finally update and display the "thank you state" div.

When the mobile version worked as intended, I added the style for the desktop version.
